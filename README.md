# odin-recipes
This is going to be a project to display everything I've learned so far in the odin project course. At the end of this project I will write a reflection.
 I spent too much time in css, and after a couple hours commented out what I was working on as I realized it wasn't appropriate for this project, and I also didn't have the proper know how to finish it without spending more time doing research. I went back to what I had already learned and finished the project.
